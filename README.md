# leaflet-challenge
A earthquakes visualization map was created using Leaflet.js that plots all of the earthquakes from geoJSON data set.
the size and color of markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake, earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker color. when a marker is clicked, a text box will popup to provide additional information about the earthquake.
